# bpfmon
BPF based visual packet rate monitor

While **tcpdump** shows _what_ packets are going through the network, bpfmon will show _how much_ in terms of bytes per second and packets per second in a nice pseudo-graphical terminal interface.

**bpfmon** also supports monitoring an iptables rule that is selected by command line option or selected from a menu.
