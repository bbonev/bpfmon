Description: traffic monitor for BPF expression/iptables rule
 While tcpdump shows what packets are going through the
 network, bpfmon will show how much in terms
 of bytes per second and packets per second in a
 nice pseudo-graphical terminal interface.
 .
 bpfmon also supports monitoring an iptables rule that
 is selected by command line option or selected from a
 menu.
